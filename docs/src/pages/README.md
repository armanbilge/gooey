# Gooey

Gooey is a Scala library to build UIs. It's focused on getting workable interfaces running very quickly, at the expense of some amount of customization.


## Getting Started

To use Gooey, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "gooey" % "@VERSION@"
```

## ScalaDoc

See the ScalaDoc @:api(gooey.index) for API documentation.
